### Hey there, 👋

**I'm Rodrigo Gonçalves Santana 👨‍🚀**. I currently develop websites with **ReactJs**, mobile applications with **React Native** and API with **NodeJs**. I also love **UX Design**. I like to create beautiful interfaces to provide the user with a pleasant experience. To create prototypes I use **Figma**, but I also know how to work with **Adobe XD**.


I have also worked with **C#**, **SQL Server**, **PHP**, **MySQL** and others. I like project architecture, writing clean code and applying good practices.


The only certainty I have is that learning is an endless road and I want to stay on it. So, I love technology, coffee and applying knowledge to solve problems, create solutions and impact lives.
