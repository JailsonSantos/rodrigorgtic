### Hey there, 👋

**I'm Rodrigo Gonçalves Santana 👨‍🚀**. I develop websites, mobile apps and APIs. Currently, my stack is: 

:computer: web sites with **ReactJs** <br/>
:iphone: mobile applications with **React Native** <br/>
:satellite: API with **NodeJs** <br/>

I also love **UX Design** :heart:. I like to create beautiful interfaces to provide the user with a pleasant experience. To create prototypes I use: **Figma**, but I also know how to work with **Adobe XD**.



I have also worked with **C#**, **SQL Server**, **PHP**, **MySQL** and others. I like project architecture, writing clean code and applying good practices.


The only certainty I have is that learning is an endless road and I want to stay on it. So, I love technology, coffee and applying knowledge to solve problems, create solutions and impact lives. :purple_heart:
