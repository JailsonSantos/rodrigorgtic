### Hey there 👋

**I'm Rodrigo Gonçalves Santana 👨‍🚀**. I develop websites, mobile apps and APIs. Currently my stack is: 

:computer: web sites with **ReactJs** <br/>
:iphone: mobile applications with **React Native** <br/>
:satellite: API with **NodeJs** <br/>
:floppy_disk: Database: **Postgres**, **Mongo**, **Redis**, **Firebase (Cloud Firestore/Real Time)**, **SQL Server**, **MySQL** <br/>

I also love **UX Design** :heart_eyes:. I like to create beautiful interfaces to provide the user with a pleasant experience. To create prototypes I use **Figma**, but I also know how to work with **Adobe XD**.



I have also worked with **C#**, **SQL Server**, **PHP**, **MySQL**, **Python** and others. I like project architecture, writing clean code and applying good practices. 


The only certainty I have is that learning is an endless road and I want to stay on it. So, I love technology, coffee and applying knowledge to solve problems, **create solutions and impact lives**. :purple_heart:
